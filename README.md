## Introduction:
Here I try to implement the mathematical properties I learn in Python.
***

## Applications/Properties implemented so far:
### Quadratic Equations' real solutions solver.
Uses the basic method of solving quadratic equation through calculating the discriminant and deducing the solutions from it.
### Factorial calculator.
Uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Integer Limit = '998'.
### Fibonacci Sequence term calculator.
Calculates the term wanted of the famous Fibonacci Sequence.
Term Limit = Unknown (Biggest term tried : 30000).
### Prime Numbers checker.
Uses the [Wilson Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_theorem) to check if a positive integer is prime or not.
To calculate the factorial, it depends on the [Factorial Calculator](#factorial-calculator).
